     You have changed me in ways I could not imagine, <br>
         In this walk of life, I could not fathom anyone else in this life,<br>
         and the next to walk with me for the rest of my life but you. <br>
         My mind craves for your presence like a flower that craves the sun, <br>
         My heart longs for your love in every single breath that I take, <br>
         My soul is overflowing of everthing that is you. <br>
         And today I thank God that we get to celebrate this moment where our lives collided,<br>
         shaping into this very moment of love and new beginnings for the both of us<br>
         I love you with all my heart always and forever.
         <br>

         Love-Eoghan
